# Hey there, I'm Neeraj ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about building and exploring cool tech projects. Currently, I'm working on **LizzardDB**, an experimental database project in Golang.

## ðŸš€ LizzardDB

**LizzardDB** is a database engine built from scratch using Golang. It's designed to dive deep into database internals with features like:

- **Advanced REPL Interface**: An interactive shell that supports complex commands and real-time feedback, designed to simulate a professional database environment.
- **Sophisticated In-Memory Storage**: Implements efficient key-value storage with support for various data structures, including future plans for caching and in-memory indexing.
- **Dynamic Indexing & Query Optimization**: Features plans to integrate B-trees for balanced indexing, LSM trees for high-write throughput, and sophisticated query processing for SQL-like operations with filtering, sorting, and joins.
- **Concurrency and Transaction Management**: Future enhancements will include support for concurrent operations and transaction handling to ensure data integrity and performance.
